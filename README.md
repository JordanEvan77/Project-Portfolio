Hello and welcome to my project portfolio. This holds a combination of my Grad projects as well as my personal projects, code mix of both R and Python. Key projects I would highlight would be the Black Jack Card Counting simulator (which uses complex Object Oriented Class systems), my Movie Recommendations Code (Which was built using collaborative filtering and deployed in an EC2 Instance) and Marketing Campaign Analysis (Business Insight focused project centered on delivering Actionable Business Insight). Please feel free to look around, and contact me with any questions through my LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-gropper-413640155
